# Stroke Prediction Using 5 Machine Learning Classifiers created from scratch(Without using any libaries)

This Project presents a comparision and selection of the best Machine Learning Classifier out of 4 which were created without using any pre-built libraries. I used Precision as a metric as the analysis of such sensitive data requires the model to accrately predict true positives.

# Models Created
- Decison Tree
- KNN
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- Random Forest

# Getting Started
Using python 3.9.5 + To reproduce the results, after ensuring all dependencies in the requirements.txt are satisfied, execute the main.py file.

python main.py

This will run all the listed algorithms and report their evaluation metrics.
